# English Vocabulary App

This app helps you practice English words. To run the quiz and the new registration server:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server (serves static files and provides `/register` and `/login` APIs):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000/index.html` for the quiz or `http://localhost:3000/login.html` to create an account and log in.

User credentials are stored in `users.json`.
